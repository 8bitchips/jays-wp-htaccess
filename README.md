An .htaccess file that I use for various Wordpress websites to improve performance, security, and functionality.
*Some* informal tests on *some* sites have seen them *appear* to double in speed instantly just by uploading this file to the website's root folder. **Your results may vary**. Heavy emphasis has been placed on blocking malicious IPs and Bots.

:warning: Caution |
------------ |
The .htaccess is a powerful file. One wrong move in the .htaccess file can make a website inaccessible. Make sure you have a backup of any original .htaccess file to restore via FTP if that happens.|

# jays-wp-htaccess

![](http://i.imgur.com/uqqPJPb.jpg)

An .htaccess file that I use for various Wordpress websites to improve performance, security, and functionality.
*Some* informal tests on *some* sites have seen them *appear* to double in speed instantly just by uploading this file to the website's root folder. **Your results may vary**.

:warning: Caution |
------------ |
The .htaccess is a powerful file. One wrong move in the .htaccess file can make a website inaccessible. Make sure you have a backup of any original .htaccess file to restore via FTP if that happens.|

This file is a mish-mash of content pulled from various sources. It's divided into a couple sections.
